<span class="default">
{t}The Issue Listing page uses a grid layout to simplify the manual search for issues in a project. You may sort for (almost) any column in this grid form, and users with the appropriate permissions may also assign selected issues to another user.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}The quick search table in the top of the screen helps the users find the issues they want quickly. More advanced searches may be created using the Advanced Search tool.{/t}
