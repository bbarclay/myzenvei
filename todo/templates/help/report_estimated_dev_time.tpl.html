<h4>{t}Estimated Development Time Field{/t}</h4>
<span class="default">
{t}This field is used by the reporters of new issues to estimate the total development time for the issue. It is especially important as a metrics tool to get a simple estimate of how much time each issue will take from discovery, going through implementation and testing up until release time.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}This field can also be used as a way to check the estimation abilities of project managers against the impact analysis given by the developers themselves. That is, the value entered by a project manager here can be compared against the impact analysis / estimated development time entered by the developers, and this way get more experience estimating the required time for new projects.{/t}
