   ABOUT
##########################
VirtueMart is an Open Source Online-Shop / Shopping Cart Web-Application.
It's a Component (means plugin / extension) for the Content Management Systems "Joomla!" and "Mambo"
and can't be used without one of both. It installs fairly easy using the automatic installers. 
It's intended for use in small / mid-sized Online businesses / Online-Shops. 
So every user who wants to build up a Online Store can use this component for selling something to customers.

This package is for New Installations and updates from mambo-phpShop. 

You just need a working Joomla/Mambo Installation. 
You can get your copy  of Joomla from http://joomla.org

This package contains some code from the original 0.8.0 Edikon Corp. phpShop distribution available at www.phpshop.org

This package was successfully tested on 
- Joomla 1.0.15
- Joomla 1.5.14

 -- IMPORTANT --
Please note that module and component SHOULD be used together! 
The thing is that you can only access all areas of the component via the VirtueMart Main Module links.

You can surely create a new Menu Item linking to VirtueMart, but you must also publish the VirtueMart module.

   INSTALLATION
##########################
The installation is really easy - 
thanks to the automatic installer!
You don't need to unpack any of the archives in this complete package!

1. If you have unpacked this archive (VirtueMart_x.x_COMPLETE_PACKAGE.zip), 
	you'll see a lot of other archives.
	- com_virtuemart_x.xxx.zip, 
	- some files beginning with mod_*.zip 
	- other packages (these are the mambots/plugins).
    
2. Login to the Administration Backend (/administrator on your site).
        
        Now go to "Installers" => "Components"
        or - if you are using an older Mambo version: "Components" --> "Install/Uninstall".
        
        You can see an upload form now.
        Select the file 
        - com_virtuemart_x.xx.zip 
        and click 'Upload Component'
        
        If everything is ok, you should see a "Welcome ..." screen.
        Choose you way of installation to finish the component installation.
        
3. Now we have to install the main module, which will help you to browse
        your categories and products.
        Go to "Installers" => "Modules"
        (or - if you're using an older Mambo version: "Modules" => "Install/Uninstall"), 
        and select the file 
        - mod_virtuemart_x.xx.zip
        and then click 'Upload module'.
    
4. The module is installed, but it still is not published!
	To publish that module on your site, you must go to the list of 
	your all modules. So now head on to 
	"Modules" => "Site Modules".
	You should somewhere see a module entry for "Virtuemart Module"
	with "mod_virtuemart" at the end of that row.
	If necessary, browse to the next page of the module list.
	If you've found the module, please select it's checkbox and click
	on "Edit" in the toolbar.
	Make your settings and don't forget to select "Published? - Yes".

       Note:
       Since unpublished modules and components appear by default on 
       the last page of  the modules listed, you may need to browse component 
       and module pages until you find the VirtueMart module.
       
	Now Save - and: Done.   
    
       Note: As long as the VirtueMart main module is NOT published, VirtueMart can't be used properly.

        IF successful, the installer will have created the following directory structure:
        
         /components/com_virtuemart
         - contains code for non-administrative surfing and ordering
         
         /components/com_virtuemart/js
         - contains JavaScript Files
		 
         /components/com_virtuemart/js/dtree
         - contains JS files and images for dTree usage.
		 
         /administrator/components/com_virtuemart/html/themes
         
         /components/com_virtuemart/shop_image
         /components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/vendor
         - contains the vendor images
		 
         /components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product
         - contains the product images
         
         /components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/ps_image
         - contains general administration/shop images
         
         /components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/stars
         
         /administrator/components/com_virtuemart
         - contains config files and the main virtuemart-parser
         
         /administrator/components/com_virtuemart/classes
         - contains all the class files
         
         /administrator/components/com_virtuemart/html
         - contains all pages accessible for the shop
         
         /administrator/components/com_virtuemart/languages
         - contains the language files
