2009-09-26
     [chg] Auto-redirect from Joomla SEF to sh404sef is now off by default,
           causes too many issues as there can be similar SEF urls giving
           different non-sef
     [chg] Prevented infinite loops when system plugin such as Moovur plugin
           calls router->parse() from output buffering handler.
           Also modified shSimpleLogger class to avoid php error in such

     [chg] Small performance improvement, removed duplicated check for cache
           file existence (only applies on first page load before file cache is
           actually stored to disk)
     [bug] Adjusted to new default language configuration variable name in

2009-09-24
     [chg] Removed use of Joomla URI to build page title when no meta plugin for

           applies transliteration to the URI elements
     [chg] Updated tooltips text for meta management activation
           Tracker #18094
     [bug] Typo in English and Spanish language files

2009-09-20
     [new] Added workaround for bug in Joomla 1.5.14 login module (action url
           for logout is relative). Would prevent users from loggint out when
           not on the frontpage, if using module (logout menu option is fine)
     [new] sh404sef will now perform an automatic 301 redirect from a Joomla SEF
           url to its equivalent sh404sef SEF url
     [new] Urls with case not matching the one used on the site will be
           (optionnally) 301-redirected to the same url with the correct case.
           ie example.com/My-Page/ will go to example.com/my-page/ (or the
           oppposite). Added new backend parameter to switch this on/off, under
           Advanced tab of configuration
2009-09-19
     [chg] BY default, adding number of items per page to Virtuemart pages is
           now on, instead of off

           Tracker #18066
     [bug] Router.php files would not always be used if present
     [bug] Deactivated auto-redirect from non-sef to sef url when using
           index2.php, instead of using tmpl=component (Virtuemart does this for
           instance, when editing in frontend)
           Tracker #18061
     [new] Added workaround for SOBI2 handling of # of items per page. Now read
           from sobi configuration table and add number of items to end of url
           if global sh404sef (Always append #items per page) is switched on.
           This way, page content is always consistent against URL.
     [new] Filter on sef url list now also searches in non-sef urls (ie can
           filter for "com_content","com_user", "view=userlist" for instance)
     [chg] Improved handling of Joomla and extensions not passing $limit value
           in url. Now also using POST values.
           Added new backend parameters to activate this handling : Always
           append # of items.

     [chg] Reverted to PHP4 compatibility
2009-09-15

     [chg] Updated language strings for backend sh404sef/router.php selector
2009-09-09
     [new] Support for Joomla router.php files. If a sh404sef native plugin is
           found, it will be used. If not, then Joomla router.php will be used.
           You can force one option or the other on a per component basis in
           sh404sef backend, under the "By component tab" using the "Do not
           override sef_ext" setting
