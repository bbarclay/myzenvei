INSTALLING / UPDATING
=====================
This package will install all the extensions in the package.
Install this package by use of the standard installer in your Joomla! administrator.

If you already have this extension installed, this package will automatically update it.
So you do not need to uninstall the extension(s) first.


INSTALLING / UPDATING MANUALLY
==============================
This extension uses the NoNumber! Elements plugin for various thing.
You may already have this installed. So please first check if the version you have
is older than the version included in this package.
If it is not installed or is older:
1) Place the contents of the 'files/elements' folder in the root of your website.

2) Place the contents of the 'files/forced' folder in the root of your website.

For first INSTALLATION:
3) Place the contents of the 'files/not_forced' folder in the root of your website (if it exists).
4) Run the manual_query.sql (if present in package) in your database.

For UPDATING:
3) You may also copy the contents of the 'files/not_forced' folder to the root of your website (if it exists),
  but these may contain files you have changed to fit your needs (like stylesheets). So it is up to you.
4) Run the manual_query_update.sql (if present in package) in your database.

NOTE: The sql queries assume you are using 'jos_' as the prefix.
      Please change that if you are using another prefix.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
You might get errors during install about not being able to write files or create folders.
Please make sure your folders have the right read/write permissions.
You can check this in your Joomla! administrator menu:
Help >> System Info >> Directory Permissions

If you still get errors, please let me know:
